Velociraptor was a small, carnivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 85 to 70 million years ago. It was about the size of a turkey, measuring roughly 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length and weighing around 30 pounds (14 kilograms).
Contrary to popular depictions in movies like "Jurassic Park," Velociraptor had feathers, which were likely used for insulation and display purposes. These feathers provide evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds.
