Tyrannosaurus rex, often referred to as T. rex, was one of the largest and most fearsome carnivorous dinosaurs that ever lived, roaming North America during the Late Cretaceous period around 68 to 66 million years ago.
T. rex had an incredible bite force, estimated to be one of the strongest in the animal kingdom. It could exert a bite force of up to 12,800 pounds, allowing it to crush bone and devour large prey.
Despite its massive size, T. rex was surprisingly fast, capable of running at speeds of up to 20-25 miles per hour for short bursts. This agility likely helped it in hunting and scavenging.
T. rex had tiny, seemingly useless arms, each with two clawed fingers. The function of these arms remains a subject of debate among scientists, with some suggesting they might have had a role in gripping during mating or supporting the dinosaur's massive body when standing up.
