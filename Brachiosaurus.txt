Brachiosaurus was a massive, herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 154 to 153 million years ago. It was one of the largest land animals to ever roam the Earth, with an estimated length of up to 85 feet (26 meters) and a height of approximately 40 to 50 feet (12 to 15 meters).
One of its most distinctive features was its long neck, which made it well-suited for reaching vegetation high in trees, unlike many other long-necked dinosaurs that fed on lower foliage.
Brachiosaurus was a sauropod, characterized by its enormous body, column-like legs, and a relatively short tail. It likely moved in herds and had a slow, lumbering gait.
